Influenza (Flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses (types A and B). Key points:
- Symptoms: sudden onset of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Gastrointestinal symptoms can occur in children.
- Transmission: droplets and aerosols from coughing, sneezing, talking; can also spread via contaminated surfaces.
- Prevention: annual vaccination, hand hygiene, masking in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, staying home when ill.
- High-risk groups: older adults, young children, pregnant people, and individuals with chronic medical conditions (asthma, heart disease, diabetes).
- Complications: pneumonia, worsening of chronic conditions, ear and sinus infections; in severe cases, hospitalization.
- Treatment: supportive care (rest, fluids, fever control); antivirals are most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset in high-risk or severe cases.
- Seek urgent care for breathing difficulty, chest pain, confusion, persistent high fever, dehydration, or if symptoms worsen after initial improvement.
